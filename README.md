# [TG] BaSiC Bot

**[@tgBaSiCBot](https://github.com/AbOutMeDK/tgBaSiCbOt) is a project initiated by team [Exam Vault](https://t.me/ExamVault) to provide a comprehensive guide for those starting their journey in Telegram Bot development.**

**This project offers a simplified Python repository to facilitate the development of a BaSiC Telegram bot. It provides a clear and accessible foundation for beginners and experienced developers alike.**

**Want to build your own Telegram bot? Let's get started!**

## Required Credentials 

- `API_ID`: Get your API ID from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).
- `API_HASH`: Get your API Hash from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).
- `BOT_TOKEN`: Get your Bot's API Token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
- `OWNER_ID`: Get your Telegram account's UserID from [@tgBaSiCBot](https://t.me/tgBaSiCBot).

**Note: If you want to know more about these Credentials then check `@tgBaSiCbOt` on telegram!**

## Deployment 

I prefer deployment on [Seenode](https://seenode.com/) because currently it is a free server.
Before proceeding to deployment first `FORK` this repository and appropriately fill your values in `config.py` file.

**In `config.py` file:**

- `PLACE_YOUR_TELEGRAM_API_ID` 
- `PLACE_YOUR_TELEGRAM_API_HASH` 
- `PLACE_YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_API_TOKEN` 
- `PLACE_YOUR_TELEGRAM_USER_ID`

Replace these with your actual values of

- `API_ID`
- `API_HASH`
- `BOT_TOKEN`
- `OWNER_ID`

## Are you a Beginner?

**Then, You just simply fork the repository first edit `config.py` as mentioned above. After your deployment is completed:**

1. Check your Bot that you created from @BotFather .
2. If you receive a message as your `/start` command reply, then your deployment was successful otherwise check the application log and you can ask your issues in our support group.
3. If your deployment is successful then you can send request for the verification of your bot.
4. Using [@tgBaSiCBot](https://t.me/tgBaSiCBot) you will be able to verify your bot once your deployment is successful.
5. After the verification process, you'll be invited yo our Private group where access is only for who builded this bot.
6. If you get the group link then you are ready to build Telegram Bots.
7. We'll help you to modify or improve this BaSiC bot to an advanced version as per your idea.
 
## Usage

To run the bot, use the following command:

`python3 main.py`
