# [TG] BaSiC Bot

**[@tgBaSiCBot](https://github.com/AbOutMeDK/tgBaSiCbOt) is a project initiated by team [Exam Vault](https://t.me/ExamVault) to provide a comprehensive guide for those starting their journey in Telegram Bot development.**

**This project offers a simplified Python repository to facilitate the development of a BaSiC Telegram bot. It provides a clear and accessible foundation for beginners and experienced developers alike.**

**Want to build your own Telegram bot? Let's get started!**

## Required Credentials 

- `API_ID`: Get your API ID from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).
- `API_HASH`: Get your API Hash from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).
- `BOT_TOKEN`: Get your Bot's API Token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
- `OWNER_ID`: Get your Telegram account's UserID from [@tgBaSiCBot](https://t.me/tgBaSiCBot).

**Note: If you want to know more about these Credentials then check `@tgBaSiCbOt` on telegram!**

## Deployment 

I prefer deployment on [Seenode](https://seenode.com/) because currently it is a free server.
Before proceeding to deployment first `FORK` this repository and appropriately fill your values in `config.py` file.

**1. In `config.py` file:**

- `PLACE_YOUR_TELEGRAM_API_ID` 
- `PLACE_YOUR_TELEGRAM_API_HASH` 
- `PLACE_YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_API_TOKEN` 
- `PLACE_YOUR_TELEGRAM_USER_ID`

Replace these with your actual values of

- `API_ID`
- `API_HASH`
- `BOT_TOKEN`
- `OWNER_ID`

**2. After deployment, follow the instructions that your bot shows. You'll be invited to join our developer's group after the verification of your bot.**

**3. Using [@tgBaSiCBot](https://t.me/tgBaSiCBot) you will be able to verify your bot once your deployment is successfully completed.**

**4. Other institutions will be shared via our developer's group, hope you'll join us soon.**

## Usage

To run the bot, use the following command:

`python3 main.py`

## For queries 

You can ask your doubts in our Support Chat : [@BaSiCBotChat](https://t.me/BaSiCBotChat)

## Happy Deploying...

**We hope this project will help those interested in building Telegram bots but don't know where to start. We're here to guide you. Let's build it together ðŸŽ‰**
